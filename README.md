# Blockparty

Simple AWS server manager for Minecraft

# BlockpartyService

I mean honestly this should work right out of the box with the install script. But also the install script was tested only once on a kind of already configured ec2 instance so open a ticket if you need help.

# BlockpartyDiscordBot

A. Why do discord bots have to run 24/7.

B. There's no install script for this. It'll eventually need to be like a systemd service (I can probably do some sort of templated systemd file in an install script)
